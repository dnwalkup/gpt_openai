## Description

Work-in-progress code for working with OpenAI GPT API. This repo currently includes tests for both GPT and Whisper models.

## Installation `git`

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Create a Python virtual environment in the project directory: `python -m venv <your_env_name_here>` 
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source your_env_name_here/bin/activate`
4. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the project: `python chatgptapi.py`

That's it! The project should now be running on your local machine.

## Usage

Standalone command-line-interface interaction with GPT including effective chat history/content.

There are a variety of ways to add your OpenAI API key. For the current implementation used in the code, a keys.py file with two vars for 'oai_organization' and 'oai_api_key' are used. This file is not included in the repo for obvious reasons, you must create your own.
